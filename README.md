Title: String Deletion and Reversal

Description:
This Python script takes a string as input and performs character deletion and reversal based on user input. The user is prompted to enter a string, specify the number of characters to delete, and then provide the characters to be deleted. The script removes the specified characters from the input string, reverses the remaining characters, and prints the result.

Usage:
1. The user is prompted to enter a string.
2. The script then prompts the user to enter the number of characters to be deleted.
3. In a loop, the user is asked to input the characters to be deleted, and the script removes these characters from the original string.
4. The script then reverses the modified string.
5. The reversed string is printed to the console.

Example:
Enter a string: hello
Enter the number of characters to be deleted: 2
Enter the characters to be deleted: e
Enter the characters to be deleted: l
Reversed and Modified String: ol

Note: The script assumes valid input, and the deletion is case-sensitive.



Title: Basic Arithmetic Operations

Description:
This Python script performs basic arithmetic operations on two input numbers. It takes two floating-point numbers as input, and then calculates and prints their addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Usage:
1. The user is prompted to enter two numbers separated by a space.
2. The script then converts the input values to floating-point numbers.
3. It performs the following operations:
   - Addition: n1 + n2
   - Subtraction: n1 - n2
   - Multiplication: n1 * n2
   - Division: n1 / n2
4. The results of each operation are printed to the console.

Example:
Enter two numbers separated by a space: 5.0 3.0
Addition: 8.0
Subtraction: 2.0
Multiplication: 15.0
Division: 1.6666666666666667

Note: The script assumes valid input in the form of two space-separated floating-point numbers.

Title: Word Replacement in Sentence

Description:
This Python script takes a sentence as input and replaces occurrences of the word "python" (case-insensitive) with the word "pythons". It splits the input sentence into words, iterates through each word, checks for the presence of "python", and builds a modified list of words. The modified words are then joined back into a sentence and printed.

Usage:
1. The user is prompted to enter a sentence.
2. The script processes the input sentence, identifies occurrences of the word "python" (case-insensitive), and replaces them with "pythons".
3. The modified sentence is printed to the console.

Example:
Enter the sentence: Python is a programming language. python programming is fun.
Modified Sentence: pythons is a programming language. pythons programming is fun.

Note: The replacement is case-insensitive, and the script assumes valid sentence input.

Title: Grading System

Description:
This Python script implements a basic grading system based on a numerical score input by the user. It categorizes the score into different grades (A, B, C, D, or F) based on predefined score ranges.

Usage:
1. The user is prompted to enter a numerical score.
2. The script evaluates the score and assigns a corresponding grade based on the following ranges:
   - A: 90 to 100
   - B: 80 to 89.9
   - C: 70 to 79.9
   - D: 60 to 69.9
   - F: Below 60
3. The assigned grade is then printed to the console.

Example:
Enter the score: 85.5
Grade: B

Note: The script assumes valid numerical input within the specified score ranges.
